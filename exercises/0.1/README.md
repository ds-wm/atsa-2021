**Exercise 0.1**

| Parameter | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
| :------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| x | 0 | 0.5 | 1.0 | 1.5 | 2.0 | 2.5 | 3.0 | 3.5 | 4.0 | 4.5 |
| y(x) | 1 | 2.5 | 4 | 5.5 | 7 | 8.5 | 10 | 11.5 | 13 | 14.5 |

Perform the following by referencing y(x) from the table above.

1. Calculate the three different means.
1. Calculate the variance.
1. Calculate the standard deviation.
1. Calculate the standard error about the mean.

For each of the operations above, create your own function that performs the operation based on the equations given and then see if there's a build-in R function that does the same computation and compare them.
