**Exercise 3.2.5**

Fit an AR(p) model to the 2014 daily average Dow Jones stock price found in the `dowjones2014` dataset.
Plot the realization along with sample autocorrelations and periodogram.
Include all parameter estimates (i.e., $\hat\phi_p$ and $\sigma_a^2$) based on the three estimator methods (i.e., Yule-Walker, Burg and Maximum-Likelihood).
Compare the results of these three methods.
