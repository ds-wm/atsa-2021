# Instructions

Labs should be completed using the R kernel in [Google Colab](https://colab.to/r); it is free to use with a Google account, such as the account associated with your W&M email.
Labs should include relevant text blocks to introduce topics, explain methods, display images/graphics, and link to resources.
Labs should include relevant code blocks to read, process, analyze and visualize data.
Labs should be formatted like a report with the following sections:

1. Introduction - a 150-300 word introduction to the purpose and scope of the lab
1. Methods - a reproducible account of your work made up of code and text blocks of all steps leading up to, but not including the final graphics, tables or figures
1. Results - final figures, tables and/or other graphics with explanations of what they represent
1. Discussion and Conclusions - a 250 to 500 word reflection on your methods and results, what worked and what didn't work, what were the challenges you faced, were the results as you expected, what inferences (if any) can you make
1. References - a list of all citations used throughout the report; every reference must be cited and all citations must show up in your references. Please use the latest APA guidelines for your citation style.

To receive a check for a lab, submit your .ipynb (or a link to your shared Jupyter Notebook) to GitHub; if sharing a link, please make certain share permissions allow for W&M user access.
Notebooks are expected at minimum to meet the following:

1. be formatted correctly,
1. be written in English with minimal typos,
1. include working links to datasets,
1. include code blocks that execute without errors (please note at the top of your notebook if any packages need to be installed),
1. include figures that adhere to the guidelines given in the instructions,
1. include references, each with appropriate in-text citations,
1. include captions for all tables and figures, and
1. include responses that answer the question(s) asked.

All labs are due on or before the exam due date for a given block.
Title your labs with your GitHub username (`dt-woods-lab1.ipynb`).

Two of the three labs will be assessed (chosen randomly; you do not get to choose which ones).
If they meet the criteria above, they receive a check.
Late labs, incomplete labs, or labs that fall short of the expectations outlined above will not receive a check.

You are free to collaborate on lab assignments, but ultimately it should reflect your thoughts, methods, and conclusions.

## Things to avoid

- Try not to print out 100x's of lines of data in your lab methods. It's better to show data summaries and just the head of a dataframe. If you want all values to show up, please consider moving the print statement to a supplemental section after your references.
- Try to avoid personal pronouns (e.g., "I" and "me" and "we") and use general third-person speech (e.g., "This report examines x, y and z")
- When definining variable names in R, be sure to check that it is not a protected keyword or primitive function. For example, don't use `sum`, `mean` or `list` as variables.

## Things to remember

- If you read in data, it's a good idea to show it (e.g., `head(df)`) and provide a summary (e.g., `summary(df)`).
- Numbering your lab sections as well as numbering your figures helps with referencing in your conclusions and discussions.
