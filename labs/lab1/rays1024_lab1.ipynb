        "# Introduction\n",
        " This project will be based on the work *Time-Series Study of Associations between Rates of People Affected by Disasters and the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Cycle* by Holly Ching Yu Lam, Andy Haines, Glenn McGregor, Emily Ying Yang Chan, and Shakoor Hajat. In the paper, Lam et al. aim at examining the annual relationships between El Niño years and PAD rates. To find the relationships, researchers perform time series regression analysis exploring the connection between ONI & MEI and PAD rates, through which they discover an annual relationship between the data. To conclude their findings, PAD rates were significantly higher during El Niño years, and the disasters typically include storms and floods. \n",
        "\n",
        "We will investigate ENSO indices and perform analysis on three time series: people affected by disaster(PAD) rates per 1000, Ocean Niño Index(ONI) and multivariate El Niño Index(MEI). (Lam et al., 2019) In addition, we will also perform time series analysis on Southern Oscillation Index(SOI), which may possess similar pattern as the time series data that were examined by Lam et al.(Climatic Research Unit, 2019)\n",

From Figure 1 that we reproduced, we can see that El Niño event is most significant in the mid-60s, -70s, -80s, -90s. In addition, it seems from the El Niño years table that the event occur for around every 3 or 4 years, which match with the period of 43 months calculated from the dominant frequencies of ONI, MEI, and SOI."

        "Over the course of this project, we conduct time series analysis on ENSO and PAD data and find El Niño years. For analyzing time series data, we use sample autocorrelation, periodogram, time series plot, and Parzen window. We are able to obtain the dominant frequency, periodic behavior, and stationarity for each time series and use them to identify El Niño years. Furthermore, we standardize the ONI values from December to February by assigning 0's and 1's to the dataframe and generating a table for a direct approximation. The result matches with the period we calculate in time seris analyses.\n",

        "However, the relationship between PAD rates and El Niño years is not very clear and more steps of analysis could be taken to further reveal the relationship. \n",
        "\n",
        "One of the challenges in this project is to aggregate population by countries and years. During calculations, the lines of code would often return null values ( numeric(0) ) and there had been much time spent debugging."
