### Lab Assignment
1. Create a new notebook with a title, your name and date.
1. Review the discussion paper above and provide a brief summary of their objective, methods, and results.
1. Find the data associated with the study (&sect;1.3.3 above) and load them into R data frames. Reproduce Figure 1 from the Lam et al. paper.
1. Correct and/or process the data into a time series
1. Investigate all the data using the sample autocorrelation and periodogram (e.g., create plots, identify patterns such as periodic versus aperiodic behavior, find dominant frequencies)
    * Be sure to include titles, axes labels and legends in your plots
1. Identify El Ni&ntilde;o years (and its dominant frequency) in the datasets you found based on the metrics provided in the paper.
1. Find another time series dataset that may also exhibit El Ni&ntilde;o like patterns: load it into R, analyze it with the tools we have.
1. Describe your conclusions from this lab. 
    * What did you do? 
    * How did the tools that you used (e.g., sample autocorrelation, periodogram, etc.) work? 
    * Were you able to find any patterns in the data?
    * What challenges did you run into (if any) and how did you overcome them?
