# Instructions 
Notes should be neat, organized, formatted in markdown and titled using your GitHub name and block number (e.g., `b1-notes_dt-woods.md`) and uploaded to this GitHub folder **at least 48 hours** before the exam due date.
Notes serve as a study guide for all students and help by providing additional perspectives, methods, and note-taking styles.


## Block 1 instructions
Provide summaries for each of the main topics discussed (i.e., Lesson 1.1 and Lesson 1.2.1 through 1.2.6) based on the lectures and provide highlights from the classroom discussions on the topical paper. 
Provide the missing vocabulary terms from the course notebook and their definitions.

## Block 2 instructions
Take minutes during your breakout meetings; how is your breakout group approaching the solutions to the two case studies?
Provide brief background information (i.e., do a web search) on the three main challenges addressed: data duplication, gap filling, and outliers.
Where else do you find these challenges?
Provide links to any helpful web resources.

## Block 3 instructions
