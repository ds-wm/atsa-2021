**Why Time Series?**
There are three main reasons why we care about Time Series in Data Science. One, data science is the field that find patterns in data. Two, Time Series is a specific type of data. Three, we use special tools to find patterns in time series. Time Series data can be useful in two cases, modelling and forecasting. 

**The Four V's of Big Data**
  - Volume
  - Velocity
  - Variety
  - Veracity (Truth)  

**Pieces of notes from the lecture slides**
  - There's a popular belief that all data is a mixture of parametric structures and stochastic noise. When the sample space of the stochastic process is time, that is time series data.
