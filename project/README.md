# Independent Project
As defined in the syllabus and course description, this class has an independent student research project.
This project will stand for the final exam and, therefore, is due by the end of exam period, which based on the [registrar](https://www.wm.edu/offices/registrar/calendarsandexams/examschedules/spring21exam/index.php#start) is 5 PM on Monday, 10 May 2021.
Requests for extensions must be made one full day before the due date both in writing (e.g., email) and in person (e.g., zoom) and cannot be extended past 10 PM on Tuesday, 18 May 2021.

## Overview
This semester, we will examine the application of time series analysis to audio files.

* You may choose the scope of your analysis and the song/composition.
* You may work in group of up to three.

The structure of the independent project follows the same structure and guidelines as a lab; therefore, it should be written up in a Jupyter Notebook, consist of specific sections, include references, and adhere to the Standards for Submitted Work.
Additionally, you will create either a podcast (audio) or vlog (video) not to exceed 10 minutes in length that summarizes your project.

A successful independent research project is measured by:

1. An informative and well-documented introduction to your study. (Introduction)
1. A logical and reproducible methodology (however complete). (Methods)
1. An insightful reflection on your methods, challenges, and what you were able to accomplish. (Discussion/Conclusions)

The project report should include at minimum:

1. One or more R plots/figures (with appropriate titles, labels and legends)
2. Table of summarized statistics (e.g., for an audio file, the number of samples, the sampling frequency, the Hertz range)
3. Three or more reputable sources (with appropriate in-text citations), including appropriate attribution to the audio file's originator.

## Proposals
Once you have formed your group (or are working independently) you should submit a <1 page proposal on your final project.
You may choose to use any of the analysis tools or techniques discussed in class and any experimental or out-of-class tools and techniques (so long as they are reproducible).
