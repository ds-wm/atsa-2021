# Final Project Proposal
In the final project, we will look at the controversial topic of music plagerism. 
The two songs we will examine are "Thinking Out Loud" by Ed Sheeran and "Let's Get It On" by Marvin Gaye.
We will first discuss what music plagerism is and how it is perceived by professionals. 
Then, we will use time series analysis techniques introduced in class to explore the frequency domain and determine the possible similarities.
One thing to note is that the result of analysis done in this project will not produce a conclusion regarding the plagerism claim. 
The focus is to determine the possible similarities rather than how these similarities contribute to the claim.
The portion of songs we will be using are three 10-second clips from each song's beginning, middle, and end.
