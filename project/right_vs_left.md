## Applied Time Series Analysis - Final Project Proposal

For my final project, I would like to analyze the differences between the left and right audio channels. 
Stereo is a method of sound reproduction that creates an ilusion of multi-directional audible perspective
where you hear sound from various directions like you would with natural hearing. Stereo is usually achieved by 
using two or more independent audio channels (left and right) and using two or more speakers (headphones). 
By enabling recorded sound to be recieved in a multi-directional way, audio and recordings can encorporate
another dimension during the recording process. I will analyze how this additional dimension is used by comparing the
frequencies in the left and right audio channels of different songs. As of right now I plan to use Stairway to Heaven
by Led Zeppelin and Money by Pink Floid as both songs are known to have made use of the stereo effect. I may
add or remove songs from my analysis as needed but I hypothesize there will be main types of differences
depending on the effect that the creator is trying to achieve.
