## Final Project Proposal  
**Monica Alicea, Kelton Berry, Andrew Caietti, Asha Silva**  

For our final project we will be analyzing the differences in three songs from three different time periods. The first song, Ave Verum Corpus by The Choir of Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral, was originally composed in 1791. Our second song, Hotel California by the Eagles, was released in 1976. The final song, Levitating by Dua Lipa featuring DaBaby was released in 2021. These three songs will allow us to investigate how song frequencies have changed over time, as well as how they differ cross-genre.
