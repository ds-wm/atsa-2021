Final Project Proposal
======================

The subject of my project will be the song "My Sweet Lord", by George
Harrison. This song features a key change about halfway through (in the
demo version). The goal of my project will be to identify this key
change using the techniques for analyzing dominant frequencies which we
used in class. Since the pitch of a note is determined by its frequency,
my hypothesis is that the dominant frequencies for the second half of
the song (where the key is raised) will be higher than the dominant
frequencies from the first half.

If this recognition is possible through manually separating the song
into its two parts, then I will aim to write a program which takes
slices of the song and tries to automatically determine where the key
change is by comparing dominant frequencies.
