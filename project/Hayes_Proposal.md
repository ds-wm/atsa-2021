ATSA Final Project Proposal
Julian Hayes

## Proposal
For my final project, I would like to analyze royalty-free music. Royalty-free music is commonly used in amateur online content and can be found from a variety of sources. These pieces of stock music, as they are sometimes called, are often labeled with various moods or feelings that they are meant to elicit. The goal of this project is to analyze the sound of these pieces to figure out the physical differences between the sounds of these different feelings and concepts, and potentially find a way to label music that does not have a pre-existing label based on how it breaks down.

For this project, I will take free files from sites like Soundcloud and break them down into samples with R. I will play around with these samples and visualize them to find similarities in some of the physical aspects we looked at in class this semester to assess the differences in various moods for stock music. This analysis will be based off of the Block 3 assignments for this class.
