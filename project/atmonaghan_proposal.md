For my independent research project, I will be utilizing the data file from lab 3 along with a new data file.  This is because the song that I analyzed for the last lab is arguably one of the worst songs of all time.  The song, "Friday" by Rebecca Black, gained popularity in 2011 through YouTube.  It became a meme, and the artist, Rebecca Black, ended up deleting the video after becoming a victim to cyberbullying.  I decided that I would compare what is considered to possibly be the worst song of 2011, to "Rolling in the Deep" by Adele, a song that was the most popular of the same year.
