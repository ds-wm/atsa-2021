For my final project, I will be comparing two audio samples of the same song ("Africa by Toto"). The two samples in question will be the original song and a cover I discovered in my research for this project by an artist named Pupsi. I'm comparing this specific cover with the original because Pupsi carves sweet potatoes and squash to use as homemade instruments in the song. You can find his Youtube video at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRLfGwQ7Nsw&t=2s. I will compare the two renditions both as simply different renditions of the same song (so basic musical differences, whether it be timing or frequency), as well as two different renditions with *very* different instruments. 

## Methodology:
-   For simplicity's sake, clip both audio files down to 30 seconds each (the same portion of the song will be used).
-   Plot and compare each audio samples' autocorrelation and periodogram.
-   Based on periodogram and differences in dominant frequencies between the two samples, attempt to filter Pupsi's sample to more closely match the dominant frequencies of the original.
-   Listen and compare Pupsi's filtered clip to Toto's unaltered clip and discuss differences and/or similarities.
